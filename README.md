ergo (and eventually more) quick portfolio

This project was written so that I could quickly get pricing for ERGO and Cardano crypto without using a wallet and manually adding it all together.

It is essentially a bunch of linked perl scripts which output to a HTML

example portfolio: https://my.ergoport.dev/cgi-bin/ergoport.pl?a=11

It can run on anything that runs Perl and PerlCGI.

I've tested on Windows (activeperl) and it is currently running on Linux VPS

To Do:
1. Fix bugs and css so this page can get bigger
2. Phone foramtting
3. Password Resets



I've also written individual html outputs of all the coins that that telegram and discord bots can grab quick pricing without having to prune or chomp anything. Users can simply do a GET command to the page and they get the pricing data accurate to the minute.
Example: https://my.ergoport.dev/cgi-bin/epAnetaBTC.pl

will return:
### CNETA/NETA Price Checker ###

cNETA: $0.015364 in USD

cNETA: 0.0286199143488895 in ADA

  ADA: $0.536829 in USD\n

 NETA: $0.005271 in USD

 NETA: 0.00246984155247183 in ERG

  ERG: $2.134145 in USD\n

Users can also send a var at the end of the URL to get the coin count price:

$15.23 USD / $0.521000 (ADA Price) = 29.232245681382 ADA
